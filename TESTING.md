component testing:
- Tested individual components such as the arrow button, delete button, image element, presentation cards, slide component, and text properties modal.
- Focused on testing the smallest, independent features to ensure each component functions correctly in isolation from others, reducing the risk of interaction-based issues.
- Verified component functionality across multiple screens within the app, ensuring consistent performance and responsiveness across different contexts.

ui testing:
- Ran out of time to actually write the second happy path test.
- Planned steps included: Registering, creating a presentation, adding text, images, and code, changing the background and font, previewing slides, rearranging slides, and logging out.
- This test would cover different features from the initial ui test to ensure a more complete check of the app's functionality.
